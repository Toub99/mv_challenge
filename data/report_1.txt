{'_id': 'trec-cds-2014-4', 'description': 'A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents for 5 days of high fever and irritability. The physical exam reveals conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, inflammation of the hands and feet, desquamation of the skin of the fingers and toes, and cervical lymphadenopathy with the smallest node at 1.5 cm. The abdominal exam demonstrates tenderness and enlarged liver. Laboratory tests report elevated alanine aminotransferase, white blood cell count of 17,580/mm, albumin 2.1 g/dL, C-reactive protein 4.5 mg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate 60 mm/h, mild normochromic, normocytic anemia, and leukocytes in urine of 20/mL with no bacteria identified. The echocardiogram shows moderate dilation of the coronary arteries with possible coronary artery aneurysm.'}
        Patient History:
        - 58-year-old nonsmoker white female
        - Mild exertional dyspnea and occasional cough
        - Asymptomatic otherwise
        - No significant medical history or allergies
        - No family history of cancer

        Clinical Findings + Diagnosis:
        - Chest x-ray: Left lung mass
        - CT scan of the head: Solitary mass in the right frontal lobe
        - Differential diagnosis:
          - Primary lung cancer with brain metastasis
          - Primary brain tumor with lung metastasis
          - Two separate primary tumors (lung and brain)

        Treatment Options:
        - Lung mass biopsy for histological confirmation and typing
        - Brain mass biopsy for histological confirmation and typing
        - Staging investigations (e.g., PET scan, MRI of the spine) to assess extent of disease
        - Multidisciplinary team (MDT) discussion involving medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and neurosurgeons to determine the most appropriate treatment plan
        - Potential treatment options may include:
          - Surgery (lung and/or brain)
          - Chemotherapy (adjuvant or palliative)
          - Radiation therapy (brain and/or lung)
          - Targeted therapy (if molecular profiling identifies actionable targets)
          - Palliative care (if disease is advanced or patient is not a candidate for curative intent therapy)
