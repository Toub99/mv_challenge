Patient History:
- Age: 8 years old
- Family History: No significant family history of respiratory diseases
- Medical History: No known medical conditions or hospitalizations
- Allergies: No known allergies

Clinical Findings:
- Fever up to 39 C
- Dyspnea
- Cough for 2 days
- Loose stools prior to fever and cough
- Respiratory distress on examination
- Bronchial respiratory sounds on the left
- Bilateral lung infiltrates on chest x-ray

Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's history of recent travel to Colorado, fever, cough, dyspnea, loose stools, and bilateral lung infiltrates on chest x-ray, the most likely diagnosis is Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) with possible co-infection of Gastroenteritis.

Treatment options:
1. Empiric antibiotic therapy with a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide (e.g., azithromycin) to cover common bacterial pathogens in CAP.
2. Supportive care, including oxygen therapy, hydration, and close monitoring of vital signs.
3. Consideration of antiviral therapy if Influenza is suspected, given the patient's recent travel to a ski resort in Colorado during the peak of flu season.
4. Possible admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for close monitoring and supportive care if the patient's condition worsens or he requires mechanical ventilation.
