**Diagnosis:**
Kawasaki Disease with possible coronary artery involvement

**Treatment Options:**
1. **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG):** High-dose IVIG (2 g/kg) should be administered as soon as possible to reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysms. This is the standard of care for Kawasaki Disease.
2. **Aspirin:** Low-dose aspirin (3-5 mg/kg/day) should be started immediately and continued until the patient's fever resolves. High-dose aspirin (80-100 mg/kg/day) may be used during the acute phase of the disease.
3. **Corticosteroids:** In cases where IVIG fails to reduce fever within 36 hours, corticosteroids (e.g., methylprednisolone) may be considered. However, their routine use is not recommended due to potential side effects.
4. **Supportive care:** This includes adequate hydration, pain management, and monitoring of the patient's condition. Close follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist is essential to monitor for coronary artery abnormalities.
