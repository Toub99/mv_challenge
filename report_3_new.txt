 She has been experiencing these symptoms for the past 6 months. She has no significant medical history and is not taking any medications. She has no known allergies. She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. She has a family history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

**Patient History:**
- 39-year-old female presenting with a 6-month history of virilization and hirsutism.
- No significant medical history.
- No current medications.
- No known allergies.
- Non-smoker, no alcohol consumption.
- Family history significant for PCOS.

**Clinical Findings:**
- Physical examination reveals signs of virilization, including deepening of the voice, muscle enlargement, and male pattern baldness.
- Hirsutism is evident with coarse hair growth on the face, chest, and abdomen.
- No other abnormal findings on physical examination.

**Diagnosis:**
- Clinical diagnosis of virilization and hirsutism, likely secondary to an underlying endocrine disorder such as PCOS, given the family history.

**Treatment Options:**
- Endocrine evaluation to identify the underlying cause, including hormonal testing (e.g., total testosterone, free testosterone, DHEA-S, 17-OHP, and LH/FSH ratio).
- If PCOS is confirmed, management may include lifestyle modifications (weight loss, diet, and exercise), oral contraceptives, or anti-androgen medications (e.g., spironolactone).
- If an androgen-producing tumor is suspected, further imaging studies (e.g., CT scan or MRI) may be required, and surgical intervention may be necessary.
- Regular follow-up to monitor progress and adjust treatment as needed.
