Nearly every organ can be affected, with the skin, lungs, heart, and gastrointestinal tract being the most common. Unspecific presenting symptoms hinder timely management, facilitating disease progression. Treatment is aimed at the underlying disease, reducing disease progression and controlling symptoms. We present the case of a 39-year-old female admitted with an acute venous thromboembolic event who developed acute hypereosinophilic-related heart failure and encephalopathy. After a thorough investigation, the diagnosis of idiopathic HES with multiorgan involvement was established, and the patient was medicated with high-dose corticosteroids, resulting in a good clinical and laboratory response. Due to non-compliance with medical treatment, disease progression culminated in death. This case highlights the multiorgan involvement in HES and the importance of treatment adherence for these patients.",

Initial investigation revealed the presence of a peritonsillar abscess and right popliteal venous thrombosis. The patient was started on intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanate, and anticoagulation with subcutaneous enoxaparin 1 mg/kg 12-hourly. Blood work revealed marked eosinophilia (14.43 x 10^9/L) not otherwise explained. A thorough past medical history investigation revealed an unspecified oesophageal pathology, as well as an unspecified pulmonary condition and skin rash four years prior to admission, for which the patient was medicated with corticosteroids, having improved. She had also been exposed to mould for several years due to her job and had lived in both Guinea-Bissau and Brazil in the past. Shortly after hospital admission, the patient developed sudden dyspnoea and hypoxemia. She maintained haemodynamic stability, and blood tests revealed increased high-sensitivity troponin T of 870 ng/L and NT-pro brain natriuretic peptide of 16,600 pg/mL. A bilateral lobar pulmonary embolism was confirmed after a computed tomography pulmonary angiogram (CTPA). As CTPA images also showed myocardial thickening, chest CT with an early arterial contrast phase was performed and revealed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus (Figure 1).",
