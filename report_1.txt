        - Asymptomatic otherwise
        - No significant medical history or allergies
        - No family history of cancer
        - Neurologic examination: unremarkable
        - CT scan of the head: solitary mass in the right frontal lobe

        Clinical Findings + Diagnosis:
        - Chest x-ray: left lung mass
        - CT scan of the head: solitary mass in the right frontal lobe

        Treatment Options:
        - Further imaging studies (PET scan, MRI) to determine the extent and nature of the lung and brain lesions
        - Biopsy of the lung mass for tissue diagnosis
        - Neurosurgical consultation for management of the brain mass
        - Pulmonary consultation for management of the lung mass
        - Consideration of systemic therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy) based on tissue diagnosis and extent of disease
        - Radiation therapy may be considered for either or both lesions, depending on the nature of the lesions and the patient's overall health
        - Regular follow-up with medical oncology, neurosurgery, and pulmonary services to monitor disease progression and response to treatment
