The patient is a 58-year-old nonsmoker who presents with mild exertional dyspnea and occasional cough. A chest x-ray revealed a left lung mass, while a CT scan of the head demonstrated a solitary mass in the right frontal lobe. Despite these findings, the patient is asymptomatic and a neurologic examination was unremarkable.
